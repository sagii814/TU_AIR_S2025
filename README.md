# BioASQ Task 1 - b: Biomedical Semantic Question Answering (Task 13b)

## Task description
- Large-scale biomedical semantic indexing and question answering
- Task goal: Biomedical questions (English) + expert (reference) answers.
  - The participants have to respond with (retrieve) relevant articles, and snippets from designated resources, as well as exact and "ideal" answers
- Document, passage, entity retrieval – you can pick one or many!
  - "clarified this with Prof. Knees: it will be sufficient to implement Phase A (list of articles and a list of snippets to be returned), which aligns well with the classical IR systems you’re expected to build. However, if you decide to also work on Phases A+ and/or B, you can earn extra points for your efforts!"
