Both volumes (measured as defined daily doses [DDD] per 1000 population) as well as drug costs (calculated per DDD) prior to and after patent expiry were calculated In order to increase price competition, government regulations focus on controlling drug costs Costs per DDD were compared using trend-line analysis",

The relative frequency of mononucleotides exhibits conspicuous local skews, suggesting that each of these chromosomal segments contains more than one DNA replication origin In general, there are significant T vs A and G vs C skews in each half of the bacterial genome, although these are almost exactly canceled out over the whole genome In other eubacteria, the most underrepresented dinucleotide is either TpA or GpT Regarding human chromosomes 6, 21, and 22, dinucleotide CpG tends to be avoided"

This approach is possible because all post-transcriptional modifications of RNA, except pseudouridine, result in a mass increase in the canonical nucleoside undergoing chemical modification Thus, DNA-based sequences reflect the state of the RNA prior to or in the absence of modification The utility of this exclusion list strategy is demonstrated through the RNA modification mapping of total tRNAs from the bacteria Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lactis, and Streptomyces griseus Creation of a DNA-based exclusion list is shown to consistently enhance the number of detected modified ribonuclease (RNase) digestion products by \u223c20% All modified RNase digestion products that were detected during standard data dependent acquisition (DDA) LC-MS/MS were also detected when the DNA-based exclusion list was used Here we demonstrate that a DNA-based exclusion list enhances data dependent liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) detection of post-transcriptionally modified nucleosides within specific RNA sequences"

Phosphorylation by protein kinase A and dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 1 modulate the inhibitory activity of phospholamban (PLN), the endogenous regulator of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) PLN undergoes a conformational transition between a relaxed (R) and tense (T) state, an equilibrium perturbed by the addition of SERCA The binding affinity of PLN to SERCA is not affected (K(d) values for the transmembrane domains of pPLN and PLN are approximately 60 microM), supporting the hypothesis that phosphorylation at Ser16 does not dissociate PLN from SERCA Since PLN can be singly or doubly phosphorylated at Ser16 and Thr17, we propose that these sites remotely control the conformation of domain Ib This cyclic mechanism constitutes the driving force for calcium reuptake from the cytoplasm into the myocite lumen, regulating cardiac contractility"

Although HILIC is today frequently employed as an orthogonal fractionation method for peptides during the proteomic discovery phase, it is still seldom considered for quantification The results showed that the maximum sensitivity in HILIC chromatography was achieved by using an amide column without salt buffer and that the signal increased compared to classic reversed phase chromatography However, the intensity improvement is quite low compared to the one obtained for small molecules The doubly charged ions can be more readily dissociated than singly charged ions, making them ideal for SRM peptide quantification As a result \"supercharging\" reagents are added to the mobile phase to shift from predominant singly charged ions to the more favorable doubly charged species"

Here, we searched for duplicated conserved noncoding elements in the human genome, using comparisons with Fugu to select putative cis-regulatory sequences We identified 124 families of duplicated elements, each containing between two and five members, that are highly conserved within and between vertebrate genomes Over two thirds of the families are conserved in duplicate in fish and appear to predate the large-scale duplication events thought to have occurred at the origin of vertebrates Although most of these elements share little sequence identity to each other, a small number are remarkably similar and appear to be the product of duplication events",

Studies on the zebrafish phox2b gene region and the ENCODE project suggest that many regulatory elements are not highly conserved, posing intriguing questions about the relationship between noncoding sequence conservation and function and the evolution of regulatory sequences.

Pharmacophore-based virtual screening is nowadays a mature technology, very well accepted in the medicinal chemistry laboratory Nevertheless, like any empirical approach, it has specific limitations and efforts to improve the methodology are still ongoing",

Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), a distant member of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 family, is a secreted protein that circulates as a 25-kDa dimer Furthermore, we find that GDF15 binds with high affinity to GDNF family receptor \u03b1-like (GFRAL), a distant relative of receptors for a distinct class of the TGF-\u03b2 superfamily ligands Finally, we demonstrate that GDF15-induced cell signaling requires the interaction of GFRAL with the coreceptor RET",

This method searches for a minimal subset of k-mers whose relative frequencies are used to build classification models as disjunctive-normal-form logic formulas (if-then rules) In this paper, we present Logic Alignment Free (LAF), a method that combines alignment-free techniques and rule-based classification algorithms in order to assign biological samples to their taxa",

Transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF\u03b21) is the principal pro-fibrotic factor, but its inhibition is associated with side effects due to its pleiotropic roles IL-11 and its receptor (IL11RA) are expressed specifically in fibroblasts, in which they drive non-canonical, ERK-dependent autocrine signalling that is required for fibrogenic protein synthesis",

Subcellular localization of BORG was not dependent on the context or level of its expression or decay but rather depended on the sequence of the mature, spliced transcript Mutational analyses indicated that nuclear localization of BORG was mediated through a novel RNA motif consisting of the pentamer sequence AGCCC with sequence restrictions at positions -8 (T or A) and -3 (G or C) relative to the first nucleotide of the pentamer Mutation of the motif to a scrambled sequence resulted in complete loss of nuclear localization, while addition of even a single copy of the motif to a cytoplasmically localized RNA was sufficient to impart nuclear localization",

To investigate the impact of pre- and postnatal pet exposure on infant gut microbiota following various birth scenarios, this study employed a large subsample of 746 infants from the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development Study (CHILD) cohort, whose mothers were enrolled during pregnancy between 2009 and 2012 Among vaginally born infants with maternal intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis exposure, Streptococcaceae were substantially and significantly reduced by pet exposure (P\u2009<\u20090.001, FDRp\u2009=\u20090.03), reflecting an 80% decreased likelihood of high abundance (OR 0.20, 95%CI, 0.06-0.70) for pet exposure during pregnancy alone and a 69% reduced likelihood (OR 0.31, 95%CI, 0.16-0.58) for exposure in the pre- and postnatal time periods Infant gut microbiota were profiled with 16S rRNA sequencing from faecal samples collected at the mean age of 3.3\u00a0months Two categories of pet exposure (i) only during pregnancy and (ii) pre- and postnatally were compared to no pet exposure under different birth scenarios.\nOver half of studied infants were exposed to at least one furry pet in the prenatal and/or postnatal periods, of which 8% were exposed in pregnancy alone and 46.8% had exposure during both time periods",

Tpr is a coiled-coil protein found near the nucleoplasmic side of the pore complex Since neither the precise localization of Tpr nor its functions are well defined, we generated antibodies to three regions of Tpr to clarify these issues Antibody localization together with imaging of GFP-Tpr in living cells revealed that Tpr is in discrete foci inside the nucleus similar to several other nucleoporins but is not present in intranuclear filamentous networks (Zimowska et al., 1997) or in long filaments extending from the pore complex (Cordes et al., 1997) as proposed",

Tpr is a large coiled-coil protein located in the nuclear basket of the nuclear pore complex for which many different functions were proposed from yeast to human.\nHere we show that depletion of Tpr by RNA interference triggers G0-G1 arrest and ultimately induces a senescent-like phenotype dependent on the presence of p53 In addition Tpr depletion impacts on level and function of the SUMO-protease SENP2 thus affecting SUMOylation regulation at the nuclear pore and overall SUMOylation in the cell.\nOur data for the first time provide evidence that a nuclear pore component plays a role in controlling cellular senescence"

Organization of chromatin by epigenetic mechanisms is essential for establishing and maintaining cellular identity in developing and adult organisms Efficient binding requires an intact trimeric PRC2 complex containing EZH2, EED and SUZ12, but is independent of the catalytic SET domain of EZH2 Using a heterologous reporter system, we show that transient recruitment of the PRC2 complex to chromatin, upstream of the transcriptional start site, is sufficient to maintain repression through endogenous PRC2 during subsequent cell divisions",

And do new therapeutic and management approaches improve the pregnancy outcomes in women with autoimmune diseases? 3) Does passage of maternal autoantibodies represent a risk to the child? 4) Do pregnancy, parity, or other factors influencing hormonal status explain the female predominance of many autoimmune diseases, and is the pregnancy effect related to microchimerism? Answering these questions has taken on additional importance in recent decades as women in western countries now frequently choose to delay pregnancies and have some or all of their pregnancies after disease onset In this paper, we primarily focus on APS, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), multiple sclerosis (MS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and type 1 diabetes (T1D)."

How can the exosome discriminate between processing or degradation of a specific substrate RNA? What is the precise structure of exosome subunits and how do they contribute to its function? Here we discuss studies that provide some insight to these questions and speculate on the mechanisms that control the exosome."

Traditionally, irritable bowel syndrome has been considered to be a disorder with no known underlying structural or biochemical explanation, but this concept is likely to be outdated Identical irritable bowel syndrome symptoms are probably due to different disease processes; grouping patients with this disorder into either diarrhoea-predominant or constipation-predominant subtypes promotes heterogeneity Additionally, possible mechanisms for gut-brain dysfunction have been identified, suggesting primary gut disturbances might be the underlying cause in a subgroup",
